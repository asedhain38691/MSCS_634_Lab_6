## Instacart Market Basket Analysis Lab

The purpose of this lab was to explore frequent itemset mining and association rule generation using the Instacart dataset. My goal was to identify commonly purchased items together, uncover hidden patterns in customer shopping behavior, and compare the performance and efficiency of the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms. By applying these methods, I aimed to gain insights into how products are associated in real-world retail data.

During my analysis, I discovered several key insights. Both Apriori and FP-Growth were able to identify frequent combinations of products, with items such as Bananas, Bag of Organic Eggs, and Yogurt appearing together often. The association rules I generated highlighted meaningful shopping patterns—for example, customers who purchase Bananas are highly likely to also buy Yogurt, demonstrating strong confidence and lift values. When I compared the two algorithms, FP-Growth was significantly faster, completing in just 0.24 seconds compared to Apriori’s 18.77 seconds, and it discovered more frequent itemsets (175 vs. 118), which illustrates its efficiency in handling large datasets.

I faced several challenges during the lab. The Instacart dataset is very large, with millions of orders and tens of thousands of products, which caused Apriori and even FP-Growth to run slowly. To address this, I downsized the dataset by sampling a subset of orders and focused on the top frequent products, which allowed both algorithms to run efficiently while still producing meaningful results. Choosing an appropriate minimum support threshold was also important to balance discovering significant itemsets while avoiding too many less meaningful combinations. I also used visualizations such as barplots and heatmaps to better understand product popularity and co-occurrence patterns before applying the mining algorithms.

Overall, this lab helped me understand the practical application of frequent itemset mining and association rules on real-world retail data. I found that FP-Growth is faster and more efficient than Apriori, particularly for large datasets, while both algorithms provide valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior and product associations. This experience reinforced the importance of data preprocessing and algorithm selection in practical data analysis projects.
